Puzzle Pandemonium

Roles: Each person is responsible for helping code, but will have an area to focus on when brainstorming new aspects. 

Concept Builder: Paula, will make sure that the game stays within the original concept and any new additions contribute to that idea

Experience Architect: Zach, will ensure the game provides a meaningful and enjoyable experience for the player, and that the design is intuitive

Craft Engineer: Kameron, will have the group focus on maintaining realistic and achievable expectations for the craft and experience of the game.

Game Mechanic: Joseph, because heâ€™s a G

Concept: Puzzle Pandemonium is a memory-based drawing game in which three players take turns constructing shapes over a playing grid and a fourth player attempts to reconstruct the picture created by the first three in a limited time.   

Platform: For this project we plan to use Java in the Processing environment in order to create our game. We feel as though this environment is the most well-known among all of our group members and offers the greatest flexibility for simple, intuItive gameplay.


Justification: We aim to make our game a collaborative experience that lets the players interact with each other more than with the game. As we were brainstorming, our group members naturally gravitated towards certain roles and we felt as though this concept allowed us to meld our goals of interaction and collaboration.
